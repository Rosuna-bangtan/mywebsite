      The website <a href="https://www.factslides.com/p-2">Factslides</a> is a simple website with the purpose
      to give users unlimited fun facts. In order to do that, it relies on the 
      HTML <i>itemscope</i> which creates a new item and associate name-value pairs with it. 
      It added the HTML <i>itemtype/i> to provide structure data. In order to change the facts, 
          it relies on the feature <i>onclick</i> with ids in order to go the previous facts and or 
          go to the next new fact. With the <i>getItem()</i> method returns value of the specified Storage Object item
          to gain the images that provides such material. The <i>div</i> tag are used more than 
          multiple times in order to keep each division organized and separated. From the border 
          with div tags that have ids such as logo, theme, categories. The "categories" feature having 
          the onmouseover and onclick="categories_toggle()" events. The most common feature was the 
          div id=i that is assigned to the <i>articleBody</i> of HTMl so it can be manipulated easily.
          This element is important because there is a different image along with different fonts to generate 
          a fact.
