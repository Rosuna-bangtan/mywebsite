  <h1>
I updated the Navbar to have a border radius in order to create an oval shape.
In addition to be able to change color when hovering the menu option. The next update was the background 
to be animated. I changed it into different colors when going to different page of the website. 
I was also be able to add flex containter to each page including the navbar so it won't seem off the 
website when adjusting the window and or to adapt to each device. Last but not least, for the opening of the page I 
removed the background and added the animation one stated earlier. Instead, I put the old background in the middle of the website 
and used another CSS transform technique to add a interactive image for users. All in all, these are the small changes 
I added to the website.
